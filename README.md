# Heist

A messaging application using Socket.io.

## Setup

```
npm install
createdb heist
npm run seed
npm run start
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may
be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily
get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```
